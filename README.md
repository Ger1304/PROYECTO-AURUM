# PROYECTO-AURUM
 In the future, human missions on Mars will not be able to rely on a constant stream of supplies from Earth.
AURUM proposes a paradigm shift: moving from a throwaway culture to circular autonomy, where every waste item becomes an opportunity.

With this system, we could drastically reduce waste volume, optimize the use of available energy and resources, and enhance astronauts’ mental health and well-being by providing them with an orderly, creative, and sustainable environment.

In the long term, this technology could extend beyond Mars—applicable to lunar bases, orbital habitats, and even on Earth, in remote communities or extreme environments.

Our “burning platform” today is turning this concept into a functional prototype: we need access to simulation tools, 3D printing, and thermal modeling capabilities, as well as collaboration with materials engineers and closed-loop systems designers.

We envision a future where every human mission can generate its own resources, minimize its footprint, and live truly sustainably.
